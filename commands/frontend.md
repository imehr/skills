Use the frontend skill to build UI components and features with the approved stack.

**Approved Stack:**
- Next.js 15 + React 19
- Shadcn UI + Radix primitives
- Tailwind CSS + CVA for variants
- Lucide React icons
- React Spring animations (NOT Framer Motion - React 19 incompatible)

**Available workflows:**
- Design-first for complex UIs (dashboards, multi-screen features)
- Component implementation with established patterns
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Accessibility standards
- Theme support (light/dark)
- Animation integration

The skill will:
1. Assess if design-first approach is needed
2. Enforce approved stack and patterns
3. Create quality checklists (responsive, accessible, themed)
4. Provide code examples and guidance

Please use the frontend skill to ensure consistent, high-quality UI implementation.
