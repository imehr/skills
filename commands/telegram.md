Use the telegram-integration skill to help with this Telegram integration task.

**Available workflows:**
- Start new Telegram bot or Mini App project
- Debug webhook and polling issues
- Add features (commands, AI, Mini Apps, inline keyboards)
- Deploy to Railway/Vercel/serverless platforms
- Fix local vs production configuration differences

Please use systematic telegram-integration skill workflows to:
1. Verify this is Telegram-related work
2. Route to the appropriate workflow (NEW_PROJECT, DEBUGGING, FEATURE_ADDITION, or DEPLOYMENT)
3. Follow environment-specific best practices (polling for local, webhooks for production)
