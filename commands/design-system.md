Use the design-system-modern-oklch skill to set up a production-ready design system with OKLCH colors (perceptually uniform), Shadcn UI components, CVA variants, custom shadows, and modern design patterns.

Perfect for Next.js/React projects needing soft, rounded, elevated aesthetics with cutting-edge color science.
