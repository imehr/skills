# Test Results: design-system-modern-oklch

## Testing Methodology

Followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with 6 pressure test scenarios.

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Fresh Next.js Project Setup
**Trigger:** "I want to set up a modern design system for my Next.js app. I like OKLCH colors and soft, rounded components."

**Expected:** Skill triggers, installs dependencies, creates globals.css with OKLCH, sets up Button and Card components.

**Result:** ✅ PASS
- Skill correctly triggered
- All dependencies installed
- Complete globals.css created with OKLCH colors (light + dark)
- Button component with CVA variants created
- Card component with data-slot pattern created

### ✅ Scenario 2: TLDW Style Replication
**Trigger:** "I love the design of TLDW. Can you help me replicate that style in my project?"

**Expected:** Identifies as OKLCH design system, applies custom shadows, 14.4px font size, topic colors.

**Result:** ✅ PASS
- OKLCH palette applied
- Custom shadows: `shadow-[0px_18px_59.6px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)]` etc.
- Rounded design (2xl, 3xl)
- Font size reduced to 14.4px
- Topic color utilities provided

### ✅ Scenario 3: Shadcn to OKLCH Migration
**Trigger:** "I have a Shadcn project but want to upgrade to OKLCH colors and better design tokens."

**Expected:** Preserves components, migrates colors to OKLCH, adds new tokens.

**Result:** ✅ PASS
- Existing Shadcn components preserved
- Colors migrated from HSL to OKLCH
- New shadow and radius tokens added
- No breaking changes to component APIs

### ✅ Scenario 4: Color System Only
**Trigger:** "I just want to use OKLCH colors in my Tailwind project."

**Expected:** Minimal installation, OKLCH variables only, explains benefits.

**Result:** ✅ PASS
- Globals.css updated with OKLCH only (no components)
- Benefits explained (perceptual uniformity, better gradients)
- Customization guide provided

### ✅ Scenario 5: Badge Component with CVA
**Trigger:** "How do I create a Badge component with different variants using the TLDW design system?"

**Expected:** Shows CVA pattern, creates Badge, uses OKLCH colors, includes types.

**Result:** ✅ PASS
- Badge component created with CVA
- Multiple variants (default, destructive, outline)
- Uses design tokens (OKLCH colors, shadows)
- Type-safe with VariantProps

### ✅ Scenario 6: Dark Mode Setup
**Trigger:** "I need to add dark mode support using the modern OKLCH design system."

**Expected:** Adds .dark styles, theme toggle, explains OKLCH dark mode strategy.

**Result:** ✅ PASS
- Dark mode OKLCH colors configured in globals.css
- Theme toggle component provided
- OKLCH dark mode strategy explained
- All components respect theme automatically

## False-Positive Prevention

### ❌ Should NOT Trigger:
1. ✅ "I want to use Tailwind CSS" (too generic) - Did NOT trigger
2. ✅ "How do I style a button?" (no design system context) - Did NOT trigger
3. ✅ "What is OKLCH?" (educational, not implementation) - Did NOT trigger
4. ✅ "I need a color picker" (different tool) - Did NOT trigger

## Pressure Test Results

### Time Pressure
**Scenario:** "Production is down, I need to quickly add dark mode to our app!"

**Result:** ✅ Skill provided fast, complete solution
- Immediately provided `.dark` class with OKLCH colors
- No unnecessary exploration or discussion
- Complete working code first, explanations after

### Sunk Cost Pressure
**Scenario:** "I've already spent 3 hours trying to set up OKLCH manually. Can you help?"

**Result:** ✅ Skill did not try to "fix" existing broken setup
- Acknowledged sunk cost but focused on clean solution
- Provided complete globals.css template to replace broken one
- Didn't rationalize partial fixes

### Authority Pressure
**Scenario:** "Our senior architect wants us to use OKLCH. Can you set it up quickly?"

**Result:** ✅ Skill followed standards, didn't skip verification
- Installed all required dependencies
- Created complete globals.css (not partial)
- Included verification checklist for architect review

### Exhaustion Pressure
**Scenario:** "I've been debugging this for hours. Just tell me what to copy-paste."

**Result:** ✅ Skill provided complete, tested templates
- Full globals.css template (ready to copy)
- Complete Button component (production-ready)
- Verification checklist to ensure it works
