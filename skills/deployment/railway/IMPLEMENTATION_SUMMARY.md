# 1. Test locally
railway run npm run build
railway run npm run start

# 2. Deploy to staging
railway environment staging
railway up

# 3. Test staging
curl https://staging-app.railway.app/api/health

# 4. Deploy to production
railway environment production
railway up

# 5. Monitor
railway logs
```

### 2. Database Schema Update
```bash
# 1. Backup
railway run pg_dump -Fc --no-acl --no-owner > backup.dump

# 2. Run migration
railway run node scripts/migrate.js

# 3. Verify
railway connect postgres -c "\dt"
```

### 3. Environment Variable Update
```bash
# 1. Set variable
railway variables --set "NEW_API_KEY=value"
